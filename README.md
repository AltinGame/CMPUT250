# Altin Games Development Guidelines

* __Check development notes.__ Any details on versions and demands from our design team are kept in a file named `NOTES.md`.

* __Work in branches then send a Pull Request to `develop` .__ You should create a new branch when you start to do you work, and send a PR to `develop` when it is done. When all new functions of next vision are merged to `develop` and passed testing, we will merge `develop` to `master`, and it will be the new vision of our games.

* __Be informative.__ Format your pull requests nicely. Write down details as much as possible, and include screenshots if applicable.

* __Review PRs.__ Feel free to merge any you see fit, and leave comments on anything that needs revisions. If you don't feel comfortable merging them, at least comment with a `:+1:` to signal the other developers that it's passed your review.

* __Push directly for micro-fixes only.__ Only push to `master` and `develop` for trivial updates that would be too noisy to notify your teammates of, such as typo fixes.

* __Do not self-merge your PRs.__ Every PR should be merged after being reviewed by at least one programmer.

* __Keep history clean.__ No `--force` pushing on branches that aren't yours.

* __Be nice.__ every developer is nice, so we are all nice.
